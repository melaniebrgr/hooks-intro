# React Hooks

- new feature in React 16.8
- compatible with existing React code

<Notes>
  No prior knowledge assumed. Shared what I've learned... Jeff is going to
  walkthrough...
</Notes>

---

# Hooks are...

- functions that "hook" into React features
- attach behaviours to functional components
- composable and shareable

<Notes>
  Replace setState, lifecycle methods without having to create a class. Like a
  React Primitive for stateful logic.
</Notes>

---

# Why Hooks

- avoid long classes
- group related side-effect logic
- address the problems HOCs and render props solve
- instead of learning a library like recompose, "just use React"

<Notes>
  HOCs wrapper hell, render props false hierarchy. Andrew Clark, stopped
  maintaining recompose, because "Hooks solves all the problems I attempted to
  address with Recompose three years ago, and more on top of that" (1).

# Types

- `useState`
- `useReducer`
- `useEffect`
- ...build your own custom hooks

<Notes>10 hook types built into React</Notes>

---

# `useState` Hook

```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

- takes initial state, returns the current state and an updater
- updater takes a new state value or a function
- calling updater queues a component re-render

<Notes>Why useState and not createState...?</Notes>

---

# `useState` Hook

```jsx
const InputField = ({ label, initialValue }) => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);

  return (
    <label>
      {label}
      <input
        type='text'
        value={value}
        onChange={e => setValue(e.target.value)}
      />
    </label>
  );
};
```

---

# Example: Refactor to `useState`

<Box width={"100vw"}>
  <CodeSandbox src={`https://codesandbox.io/embed/w67j72v2mw?fontsize=14`} />
</Box>
