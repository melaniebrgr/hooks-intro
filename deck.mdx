# What are Hooks

- functions that â€œhook" into React features, and
- "attach" behaviours to functional components.
- They can be composed and shared between components.

<Notes>
  Replace setState, lifecycle methods without having to create a class. Like a
  React Primitive for stateful logic.

# Why Hooks

- avoids long classes
- groups related side-effect logic
- address the problems HOCs and render props were used to solve
- instead of learning a library like recompose, "just use React"

<Notes>
  HOCs wrapper hell, render props false hierarchy. Andrew Clark, stopped
  maintaining recompose, because "Hooks solves all the problems I attempted to
  address with Recompose three years ago, and more on top of that" (1).
