# React Hooks

- new feature in React 16.8
- compatible with existing React code
  <Notes>
    No prior knowledge assumed. Shared what I've learned... Jeff is going to
    walkthrough...
  </Notes>

---

# Hooks are...

- functions that "hook" into React features
- attach behaviours to functional components
- composable and shareable

<Notes>
  Replace setState, lifecycle methods without having to create a class. Like a
  React Primitive for stateful logic.
</Notes>

---

# Example of a hook

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

const InputField = ({ label, initialValue }) => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);

  return (
    <input type='text' value={value} onChange={e => setValue(e.target.value)} />
  );
};
```

<Notes>Hooks are just functions</Notes>

---

# Why Hooks?

- avoid long classes
- group related side-effect logic
- address the problems HOCs and render props solve
- instead of learning a library like recompose, "just use React"

<Notes>
  HOCs wrapper hell, render props false hierarchy. Andrew Clark, stopped
  maintaining recompose, because "Hooks solves all the problems I attempted to
  address with Recompose three years ago, and more on top of that".
</Notes>

# Types of Hooks

- `useState`
- `useReducer`
- `useEffect`
- ...build your own custom hooks

<Notes>10 hook types built into React</Notes>

---

# `useState` Hook

```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

- takes initial state, returns the current state and an updater
- updater takes a new state value or a function
- calling updater queues a component re-render
- replaces `setState`

<Notes>Why useState and not createState...?</Notes>

---

# Example: Refactor to `useState`

<Box width={"100vw"}>
  <CodeSandbox src={`https://codesandbox.io/embed/w67j72v2mw?fontsize=22`} />
</Box>

---

# Comparison: Forms with Classes

<Box width={"100vw"}>
  <CodeSandbox src={`https://codesandbox.io/embed/vm87y7w5?fontsize=22`} />
</Box>

# Comparison: Forms with Hooks

<Box width={"100vw"}>
  <CodeSandbox src={`https://codesandbox.io/embed/vqk3pj0my3?fontsize=22`} />
</Box>

---

# `useReducer` Hook

```js
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
```

- an alternative to `useState`
- prefer `useReducer` when...
  - state logic is complex or nested (is an object)
  - there is a lot of state in the component and want to collocate

---

# `useEffect` Hook

```js
useEffect(didUpdate, ?dependencies);
```

- short for use side-effect
- use for fetching data, timers, intervals, logging
- use for effects previously called in CDM, CDU, CWU
- dependencies determine when effect runs

<Notes>
  use [side] effect. Running useEffect defered until after the browser has
  painted
</Notes>

---

# `useEffect` with State

![useEffect](/use-effect.png "Ryan Florence useEffect")

"whenever this state changes, run this effect"

---

# Example: `useEffect` State Dependencies

<Box width={"100vw"}>
  <CodeSandbox src={`https://codesandbox.io/embed/jlpxj27l6w?fontsize=22`} />
</Box>

---

# Rules of Hooks

- only call in functional components or other custom hooks.
- only call at the top
- don't call inside conditions or loops
- custom hooks can return anything
- prefix custom hooks with `use` for linting

<Notes>
  must be called in the same order in every component render. not just arrays
  can be returned
</Notes>

---

# Summary

Hooks are just functions.
Call inside functional components to add React behaviours.

---

# How does this affect us?

- How should we adopt?
  - for new code?
  - for existing code?
  - existing HOCs, render props?
- When should we use hooks?
- How should we test?

<Notes>
  how: upgrade from react 16.6. when: not very much (most components sb
  stateless). test: integration tests with react testing library (tests should
  resemble how code is used). Questions?
</Notes>
